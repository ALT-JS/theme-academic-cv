title: Zen
summary: This is a Meta Quest track project for the Stanford XR Hackathon. We focused on recovering human psychological dysfunctions, aiming to provide a comprehensive treatment protocol by designing multiple simple interactive meditation games utilizing the power of Meta Quest3. We build interactive environments from scratch in Unity; users can choose different environments, background music, and meditation guidance in Zen.
